# Generation Flow

## End-To-End Flow

The repository turns a small `MODULE.bazel` declaration into a generated
toolchain repository through these steps:

1. `extensions/gcc.bzl` collects `gcc.toolchain` and `gcc.sdp` tags.
2. Package metadata is resolved from `packages/version_matrix.bzl` or from an
   explicit `gcc.sdp` declaration.
3. `rules/gcc.bzl` renders a BUILD file and configuration files into a new
   repository.
4. Platform-specific templates from `templates/linux/` or `templates/qnx/` are
   populated with CPU, version, licensing, and flag information.
5. The consuming workspace enables the generated toolchain with
   `--extra_toolchains` and compatible platform constraints.

## Subsystem Roles

`packages/version_matrix.bzl`

Defines the supported package matrix. Each entry maps a logical toolchain key
to download metadata and, when needed, extra compiler or linker flags.

`rules/common.bzl`

Provides small helpers that convert lists of flags into the Bazel `flag_group`
representation needed by the templates and repository rules.

`rules/gcc.bzl`

Generates the toolchain repository. It decides whether Linux or QNX template
content is required, performs placeholder substitution, and emits the final
`BUILD`, `cc_toolchain_config.bzl`, `flags.bzl`, and Linux `gcov` wrapper
files.

## Template Families

Linux templates:

- `templates/linux/cc_toolchain_config.bzl.template`
- `templates/linux/cc_toolchain_flags.bzl.template`
- `templates/linux/cc_gcov_wrapper.template`

QNX templates:

- `templates/qnx/cc_toolchain_config.bzl.template`
- `templates/qnx/cc_toolchain_flags.bzl.template`

Shared template:

- `templates/BUILD.template`

## Important Implementation Details

- Some package definitions rely on the `%{toolchain_pkg}%` placeholder, which
  is rewritten to the canonical Bzlmod repository name during repository-rule
  generation.
- QNX `aarch64` is mapped internally to `aarch64le` where required by the
  underlying SDK layout.
- SDP version `8.0.4` is normalized to `8.0.0` in the generated toolchain
  configuration because platform constraint support currently uses the older
  identifier.
- Linux toolchains generate an extra `gcov_wrapper` script to work around the
  current `rules_cc` coverage integration behavior.

## Version Matrix Responsibilities

The version matrix is more than a list of URLs. It is also the place where the
repository centralizes:

- package build-file selection,
- archive extraction prefixes,
- sysroot-specific compiler flags,
- extra link flags,
- compiler library search paths,
- runtime-ecosystem variants such as AutoSD or EB corbos Linux for Safety Applications.
