# Examples And Validation

## Example Workspace Purpose

The `examples/` directory is a separate Bazel workspace used as a lightweight
integration test bed for the repository.

It demonstrates how consumers declare toolchains while also serving as the main
smoke-test surface for validating that the generated toolchains can build and,
where appropriate, run example targets.

## Important Files

`examples/MODULE.bazel`

Declares representative Linux and QNX toolchain repositories and wires the
example workspace back to the local checkout with `local_path_override`.

`examples/.bazelrc`

Defines named Bazel configurations that activate the generated toolchains and
platforms.

`examples/BUILD`

Contains small C++ targets used to verify compilation, linking, pthread
support, and sanitizer integration.

`examples/test.sh`

Matrix runner that maps each configuration name to a small build or test
sequence.

## Smoke-Test Matrix

The example workspace currently validates these configuration groups:

- Linux host toolchains
- Linux cross-compilation toolchains
- runtime-specific Linux toolchains such as AutoSD and EB corbos Linux for Safety Applications
- packaged QNX toolchains

The smoke-test runner isolates Bazel state per configuration so it does not
rely on `bazel clean --expunge` between cases.

## Useful Commands

```bash
cd examples
./test.sh --list
./test.sh host_config_1
./test.sh --keep-going
```

## What The Tests Prove

The example workspace is not intended to be an exhaustive compiler correctness
suite. Instead, it answers a narrower question: did the configuration
repository produce a usable toolchain definition for each supported scenario?

In practice this means checking among other things:

- successful compilation with the selected compiler and sysroot,
- correct toolchain registration and platform matching,
- basic linking behavior,
- feature coverage such as pthread-enabled builds,
- optional sanitizer feature wiring for the local Linux toolchain path.
